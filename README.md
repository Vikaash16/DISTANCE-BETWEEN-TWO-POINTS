# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Using import math function , do the calculations
### Step 2:
Take the two coordinates as |1 and |2
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: 
Using the print function , display the distance between the two points.
### Step 5: 
End the program
### PROGRAM:
```

import math
list1=[4,2]
list2=[10,6]
distance=math.sqrt((list2[0]-list1[0])**2+(list2[1]-list1[1])**2)
print(f"{distance:.2f}")
```
  
### OUTPUT:
